#
# When you run npm as root (this is the default user in Docker build) and
# install a global package, for security reasons, npm installs and executes
# binaries as user nobody, who doesn't have any permissions. This is for
# security reasons.

# Get around this by adding the --unsafe-perm flag
RUN nodenv exec npm install --global --unsafe-perm yarn
