# Baked-PDF Styles Framework guide

## Overview
A general understanding of SASS is required to use this framework [Official Sass Documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html).
The framework is modular, and is built on 3 levels, the framework, theme, and book level.
The baked-pdf styling framework was designed in a way so that the user of the framework has the ability easily generate a styled baked-pdf without applying book specific designs.

**Note:** Files named with a leading `_` do not produce any CSS output during compilation, they are imported in another file. This allows us to have control over the compiling order of our files.

**Note:** Avoid placing raw values into files that are not `_settings.scss` or `_map.scss`.

## Concepts

### Definitions
- Design Specs: a visual design requirement given a markup structure 
- Design: a coherent set of design specs that reflects designer intent
  - Multiple designs can be used for a book 
- Template: a set of design specs from a variety of designs
- Design Space: a complete set of styling definitions given a markup structure
- Design Superspace: within a design space, a set of styling properties given a markup structure
- Design Subspace: within a desgin superspace, a set of property values given a markup structure 
  - Properties are the same, values are different 
The designer will provide the design. 
The design will contain design specifications or design specs that give details about the design requirement based on a markup structure. 
The markup is very important and helps to define not only the design specs but the design space as well. 
Imagine that you are given the markup for a table. There are seemingly endless combinations of properties that you could apply to this table. This describes the design space for the table markup.
A design space depends on the markup and is restricted by it. 
Within a design space, design superspaces and design subspaces are found. 
The design superspace can be seen as a parent to the design subspace. 
Design superspaces vary in properties while design subspaces vary in property values. 
For example, if table1 requires only a color and background property, and table2 only requires a border property, styles for table1 will be derived from superspace1 and styles for table2 will be derived from superspace2.
In another example, if table1 and table2 both require the same properties but different values, both of their styles will be derived from the same superspace but different subspaces. 

### How will these concepts be implemented (a rough summary)? 
The `./styles` directory will be reorganized: 
```bash
    |-- `./Framework`
    |-- `./Design`
          |-- `./lisa-design`
          |-- `./maher-design`
    |-- `./Templates`
          |-- `template-name.scss`
          |-- `settings.scss`
          |-- `color-map.scss`
    |-- `./Book`
          |-- `book-name.scss`

```
- `./Framework` will contain global variables for values such as `$NOT_NULL` and various functions and mixins to use throughout `./styles`
- `./Design` contains super and subspaces grouped by the specific design from which they came 
- `./Templates` contain the individual templates which are made up of a combination of design specs from ./Design
- `./Book` contains book specific styles

## Development
### Generating a Styled Baked-PDF Locally
(*The Baked-PDF pipeline is currently being developed*)

**Step 1**
To generate a styled baked-pdf for a new or previously un-styled baked-book (skip to step 2 if these files exist):
- Create a directory with the book name in `./books`. `./books/book-name`
- Create `_import-config.scss` and `{book-name}.scss`
- Create `.book-name/config` and inside `./config` create `./config/_color-map.scss`, `./config/_font-map.scss`, `./config/_icon-map.scss`, and `./config/_settings.scss`
- Inside of `./config/{book-name}.scss` import files from the framework and theme and create the `$notes` map to style the book notes. (See [./config/intro-business/book.scss](./config/intro-business/book.scss) for an example)

**Step 2**
Run the sass command to compile the .scss book file to a .css file `sass ./{book-file}.scss ./output/{book-file}.css`

Then run Prince on the XTML file with the PrinceXML command `prince --style ./output/{book-file}.css ./data/{book-name}/collection.baked.xhtml`

The output styled PDF will be located in the `./data` directory.

### Framework
If styling a baked-pdf was compared to the construction of a home, the `./framework` would be the steel and wooden beams. It is a necessary component, and you cannot style a baked-pdf without it.

The code in `./framework` should not have to be changed during the development of a book, as it is the basis of baked-pdf styling, and changes to `./framework` will affect **all** previously styled books in the baked-pdf library.

- `./framework/config/`
    - `_color-map.scss`, `_color-scheme.scss`, `_constants.scss`, `_font-map.scss`, `_icon-map.scss`, `_settings.scss`
      - Explained in the 'Schemes and Maps (How do they work?)' section
- `./framework/_import-config.scss`
  - Contains imported files from ./framework/config.
- `./framework/_import-mixins.scss`
  - Contains imported files from ./framework/mixins
- `./framework/_update-config.scss`
  - Contains `@include`s of the update-config functions.
- `./framework/base.scss`
  - Contains imports and styles related to the elements present in all OpenStax PDFs (ex: default `color` and `font-size` of body text)
- `./framework/import-style.scss`
  - Contains imported files from ./framework/style 

### Schemes and Maps (How do they work?)
Mapping is a native functionality of SASS and is used heavily in the baked-pdf styling framework. For general documentation on mapping in SASS refer to this [link](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps).

**Assigning Color Values**
- To assign a color to an element, use the `color-scheme` function. Example: `color-scheme(key)`. When `color-scheme(key)` is used, this is what is happening 'behind the scenes':
  * The function `color-scheme` first uses the key passed into it to check if the `$color-scheme` map has that key.
  * Once it confirms that it does exist, it calls the `map-get` function and returns that value of the key passed into the function.

**Color Schemes**
- The default color scheme can be found in [./framework/config/_color-scheme.scss](./framework/config/_color-scheme.scss).

- Hexs and other raw color values are stored in the `_color-scheme.scss` files and can be created at the theme and book level.

When including `color-scheme-merge`, this is what is happening in the background (also applicable to `color-map-merge` and other `-merge` mixins):
1. The `color-scheme-merge` appends the passed function to the `$color-scheme-manifest` map
2. The `update-color-scheme-config` is then called
3. When the sass is compiled for an individual book, the manifest will update each time `color-scheme-merge` is called.
4. Each new key/value pair that was appended to the `$color-scheme-manifest` is now merged into a new map with the old key/value pairs previously in the `$color-scheme-manifest`. The new values take precedence over the old values.

**Color Maps**
Raw color values are stored in a map in the color-scheme and those values are called in the color-map and assigned to more descriptive names based on what they're used for.
Like color schemes, color maps exist on the framework level and can be created on the theme and book level.

The `scale-uniform` function decreases all values in an RGB by an equal proportion.
Example: `scale-uniform(rgb(100,100,100), 0.6)` -> `rgb(60,60,60)`

**Font and Icon Maps**
The font and icon maps on the framework level have a `default-font-map` function, `$font/icon-manifest` map, and `update-font/icon-config` mixin and works similarly to the color-scheme on the framework level.

**Settings**
Although `./_settings.scss` does not share the same naming conventions as the font and color map files, it works in the same way as them.

**Constants**
Contains functions that return book constants such as page width and height.
